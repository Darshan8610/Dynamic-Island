/**
 * Resolves album artwork for the island.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * The tracker already reads `MediaMetadata` bitmaps, and for a self-contained
 * player that is enough. It is not enough in practice:
 *
 *  - **Most players publish a URI, not a bitmap.** Spotify, YouTube Music and
 *    others commonly set `METADATA_KEY_ALBUM_ART_URI` and leave the bitmap keys
 *    empty, because shipping a `Bitmap` across a binder transaction is expensive.
 *    Reading only the bitmap keys therefore shows a placeholder for exactly the
 *    apps users care most about.
 *  - **Some publish neither.** A locally-indexed file whose tags carry no cover
 *    has no metadata artwork at all, but the platform may still have one — from
 *    a sibling track on the same album, or a folder image.
 *
 * So resolution is a three-step fallback, cheapest and most specific first:
 *
 *  1. the player's own artwork URI,
 *  2. that URI's `MediaStore` thumbnail (for `content://` URIs, the platform
 *     generates and caches one),
 *  3. the platform's album art for the playing track.
 *
 * ### Bitmap identity
 *
 * Results are cached by URI string. The cache is small and bounded by
 * [MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES] because artwork is large and this is a service that runs
 * for days: an unbounded cache here is a slow memory leak, and the obvious
 * "cache it forever" instinct is the wrong one for a background component.

     * The value is an [Entry] rather than a bare `Bitmap?` because

     * "no artwork" result throws a `NullPointerException`, which is how this
